            <h2>Jacob 5:47</h2>
            <p>But what could I have done more in my vineyard? 
            Have I slackened mine hand, that I have not nourished it? 
            Nay, I have nourished it, and I have digged about it, and 
            I have pruned it, and I have dunged it; and I have stretched 
            forth mine hand almost all the day long, and the end draweth 
            nigh. And it grieveth me that I should hew down all the trees 
            f my vineyard, and cast them into the fire that they should be 
            burned. Who is it that has corrupted my vineyard?</p>

            <h2>2 Nephi 32:3</h2>
            <p>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, 
            they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, 
            feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ 
            will tell you all things what ye should do.</p>
